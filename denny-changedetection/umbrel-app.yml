  🔍Changedetection is a tool that tracks changes on websites, such as price updates or content revisions. It notifies users of updates via email, Slack, or Discord. With its cloud-based setup, no installation is needed, making it convenient for monitoring multiple pages. Features include custom alerts, JSON/XML tracking for specific content, and restock notifications. It's especially helpful for monitoring products with limited availability or time-sensitive content.
